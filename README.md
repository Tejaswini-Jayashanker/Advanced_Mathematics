# Advanced_Mathematics
This is a repository that contains Mathematics required for Machine Learning from the basics.
I usually refer to Engineering Mathematics Textbooks as per VTU 2010 Scheme, also CBSE NCRT Textbooks for class 11th and 12th as per 2011-2013 syllabus.

This repository is created and will be updated to have basic understanding of Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability and Calculus.
These topics are covered as they are important for Machine Learning/ Dep Learning.
